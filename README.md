## Overview

The project automates the creation of the following AWS resources:
- A VPC with public subnets
- An S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
- EC2 instances with Nginx installed
- Load balancer for distributing traffic

Jenkins is used to trigger the deployment and manage the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the infrastructure can be provisioned with ease.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)
- AWS account with IAM permissions to create resources
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vijay-saw/terraform-s3-static-hosting-demo.git
   cd terraform-s3-static-hosting-demo
Update the variables.tf file with your AWS configurations (e.g., bucketname, vpcidr, subnetcidr).

In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it to point to your GitHub repository.

Set up the AWS credentials in Jenkins under "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials".

Pipeline Structure
The Jenkins pipeline consists of the following stages:

Clone GitHub Repository: Pulls the latest code from the repository.
Initialize Terraform: Runs terraform init to prepare the working directory.
Apply Terraform Changes: Runs terraform apply to provision the defined infrastructure.
Destroy Resources: Optional stage that allows for the destruction of resources when needed.
Usage
To deploy the infrastructure:

Run the Jenkins job. This will execute the pipeline stages and provision the resources in AWS.
Monitor the Jenkins console output for any errors or messages.
Outputs
After deployment, the following outputs will be available:

Website Endpoint for the S3 bucket
EC2 Instance IDs for the created instances
